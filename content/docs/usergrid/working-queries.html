<h1 id="working-with-queries">Working with queries</h1>

<p>When querying your Apache Usergrid data, you can use your query string to
get the data, then sort and manage it on the client. This topic
describes a few useful techniques.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: For introductory information about queries, be sure to see
<a href="/app-services-data-query-overview">Apache Usergrid data query overview</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong>Query examples in this content are shown unencoded to make
them easier to read. Keep in mind that you might need to encode query
strings if you're sending them as part of URLs, such as when you're
executing them with the cURL tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="retrieving-values-for-multiple-properties">Retrieving values for multiple properties</h2>

<p>Your query can return multiple kinds of values – such as the values of
multiple properties – by specifying the property names in your select
statement as a comma-separated list.</p>

<p>For example, the following request returns the address and phone number
of users whose name is Gladys Kravitz:</p>

<pre><code>/users?ql=select address,phone_number where name = 'Gladys Kravitz'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="querying-for-the-contents-of-text">Querying for the contents of text</h2>

<p>Your query can search the text of entity values of the string data type.
For example, you can search a postal code field for values that start
with a specific three numbers.</p>

<p>For example, the following query selects all restaurants with the word
<code>diner</code> in the name:</p>

<pre><code>/restaurants?ql=select * where name contains 'diner'
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all string properties of the default entities are
indexed for searching. This includes the <code>User</code> entity's <code>username</code>
property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following table lists a few examples of the kind of searches you can
do in queries.</p>

|                         |                         | The return results are  |

<h2 id="sorting-results">Sorting results</h2>

<p>You can return query results that are sorted in the order you specify.
Use the <code>order by</code> clause to specify the property to sort by, along with
the order in which results should be sorted. The syntax for the clause
is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>order by &lt;property_name&gt; asc | desc
</code></pre>

<p>The following table includes a few examples:</p>

<p>+————————————–+————————————–+
| Goal                                 | Example                              |
+======================================+======================================+
| Sort by first name in ascending      |     /users?ql=select * where lastnam |
| order                                | e = 'Smith' order by firstname asc   |
+————————————–+————————————–+
| Sort by first name in descending     |     /users?ql=select * where lastnam |
| order                                | e = 'Smith' order by firstname desc  |
+————————————–+————————————–+
| Sort by last name, then first name   |     /users?ql=select * where lastnam |
| in ascending order                   | e contains 'Sm*' order by lastname a |
|                                      | sc, firstname asc                    |
+————————————–+————————————–+</p>

<h2 id="managing-large-sets-of-results">Managing large sets of results</h2>

<p>When your query might return more results than you want to display to
the user at once, you can use the limit parameter with cursors or API
methods to manage the display of results. By default, query results are
limited to 10 at a time. You can adjust this by setting the limit
parameter to a value you prefer.</p>

<p>For example, you might execute a query that could potentially return
hundreds of results, but you want to display 20 of those at a time to
users. To do this, your code sets the limit parameter to 20 when
querying for data, then provides a way for the user to request more of
the results when they're ready.</p>

<p>You would use the following parameters in your query:</p>

<p>+————————-+————————-+————————-+
| Parameter               | Type                    | Description             |
+=========================+=========================+=========================+
| <code>limit</code>                 | integer                 | Number of results to    |
|                         |                         | return. The maximum     |
|                         |                         | number of results is    |
|                         |                         | 1,000. Specifying a     |
|                         |                         | limit greater than      |
|                         |                         | 1,000 will result in a  |
|                         |                         | limit of 1,000.         |
|                         |                         |                         |
|                         |                         | Limit is applied to the |
|                         |                         | collection, not the     |
|                         |                         | query string. For       |
|                         |                         | example, the following  |
|                         |                         | query will find the     |
|                         |                         | first 100 entities in   |
|                         |                         | the books collection,   |
|                         |                         | then from that set      |
|                         |                         | return the ones with    |
|                         |                         | author='Hemingway':     |
|                         |                         |                         |
|                         |                         |     /books?ql=author =  |

|                         |                         | You can also use the    |
|                         |                         | limit parameter on a    |

|                         |                         | example is shorthand    |
|                         |                         | for selecting all books |
|                         |                         | and limiting by 100 at  |
|                         |                         | a time:                 |
|                         |                         |                         |

|                         |                         | Using a limit on a      |

|                         |                         | data. For example you   |
|                         |                         | can delete all of the   |
